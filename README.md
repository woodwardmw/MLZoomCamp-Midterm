## Introduction
In phonetics, it is generally known that the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract of the speaker can be used to determine the quality of the vowel being spoken. These resonant frequencies 

Here I have taken data of English speakers pronouncing eleven different vowels in their language. The data is taken from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+%28Vowel+Recognition+-+Deterding+Data%29).

The data consists of 15 speakers each pronouncing 11 vowels, six times each. The phonetic data is then processed, and classified as formats from f0 to f9, and recorded together with data about which speaker has made the sound and the sex of the speaker.

The data I used came from [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/undocumented/connectionist-bench/vowel/vowel-context.data).
